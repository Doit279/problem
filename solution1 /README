Partial solution to 2010 Assignment 1.

Intended to demonstrate core requirements only.

Requires index.php and category_list.php to be aliases.

Required URL Is ".../solution1/" or ".../solution1/category_list.php".

Provides minimal but adequate documentation.

Uses tables categories and items.

Uses fields item summary and details instead of item name, description,
vendor and price.  But it does handle categories correctly.

Performs only minimal user input validation.

Requires users to re-enter form data when initial form data is not valid,
because the best way to avoid this is to use session variables which are
not required for this assignment.

Does not check for errors, e.g., with invalid ids, hardly at all.
